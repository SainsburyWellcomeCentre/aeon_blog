# Style and Documentation Guidelines

The purpose of this document is to establish Project Aeon code style and documentation guidelines.

We generally adhere to [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), [pep257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/), and [google's style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for code and docstring style guidelines. We run black, ruff, and pyright to format our Python code, the config settings for which can be found in a repository's `pyproject.toml`.

## General Guidelines

* All files contain a header that briefly describes the contents within a few sentences.
* In general, more lines for the sake of clarity is preferred over brevity.

## Function and Class Docstrings

* Function names should describe the action they perform. Functions have the following sections in the given order:
	- One-line summary description, typically as a verb phrase
	- Long description (optional)
	- Inputs
	- Outputs
	- Examples (optional if included in a separate file)
	- Warnings/Exceptions (optional)
	- Additional notes (optional)
	- See also (optional)
	- Todos (optional)
* Class names should describe the entity they represent. Classes have the following sections in the given order:
	- One-line summary description, typically as a noun phrase
	- Properties / Attributes
	- Long description (optional)
	- Examples (optional if included in a separate file)
	- Warnings/Exceptions (optional)
	- Additional notes (optional)
	- See also (optional)
	- Todos (optional)

## Whitespace conventions

* A tab/indent is set at four spaces.
* Vertical whitespace is used sparingly, but can be used to improve readability between code blocks/sections.
* Horizontal whitespace is used sparingly, but can be used to improve readability between long and/or complex operations and conditionals.
* Each line contains no more than 108 characters.
* Line terminations are LF, not CRLF.

## Comment conventions

* Block comments are written as full sentences above the corresponding code. 
* Inline comments are written as a short phrase that starts two spaces after the corresponding code.
* Code referenced in comments are surrounded by back ticks for readability.
* Comments are used to describe variables where they are declared.

## Additional Conventions

* Naming conventions:
	- Variable and function names are in lower snake_case (e.g. `exp_ref`, `infer_parameters` with a `_` in between each individual word representation).
	- Classes are in upper Snake_Case (e.g. `Alyx_Panel`).
	- Prefix 'n' is used for integer values e.g. `n_items`.
	- Suffix 'num' is used for referring to a particular instance e.g. `item_num`.
	- Suffices that indicate unit measurement are used when using multiple units e.g. `wheel_deg` and `wheel_mm`.
	- Re-use of variable names (i.e. mutation) is generally avoided.
	- Variables across related files which share names should share meanings.
* Comments are for explaining _what_ a particular chunk of code does when it may be unintuitive, not for explaining exactly _how_ the code does what it does.
* Block comments read as a narrative.
* In function calls, keyword arguments should should be specified when not obvious.
* Leading underscores are reserved for "private" functions.
